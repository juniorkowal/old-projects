# Stable Diffusion Image Generator

This notebook is designed for generating images using the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model, leveraging the `diffusers` library for diffusion and a custom GUI built with IPython. It was primarily used to test LoRA models I trained on my custom datasets, generate character tokens for a D&D game, and serve as a quick demo for friends.

**Note:** This notebook may be outdated, as it hasn't been maintained in a while.
