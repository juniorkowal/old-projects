# old-projects

This repo is basically a dumping ground for old random projects, most of which come from my university days. The projects vary a lot in terms of scope and quality—some were thrown together in an evening, while others were group efforts that took weeks to finish.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what you’ll find here:

- **One-off projects**: Stuff I hacked together in a few hours. Expect messy code and half-baked ideas.
- **Group projects**: There are a few collabs with 2 or more people, usually for class assignments.
- **Big project**: There's one large project here, *homm3bot*, which was built by a group of 10 people over an entire semester.

Most of these are here for nostalgia or just to have them somewhere. Feel free to poke around, but no guarantees everything works (or makes sense) anymore!
